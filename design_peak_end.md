What does the world's most popular
0:02
rental app, an Apple design award
0:05
winner, and one of Silicon Valley's
0:08
biggest success stories all have in
0:10
common. It's not just good designs. How
0:12
they master two simple but critical
0:16
moments, the peak and the end. In this
0:20
video, I'll show you how they do it.
0:22
Drawing from a decade of experience
0:25
designing for both scrappy startups and
0:28
global tech giants, you'll learn how
0:30
these apps intentionally design those
0:33
moments to keep you hooked and the exact
0:36
checklist you can use to do the same for
0:39
your own product. But to make sense of
0:42
this entire concept, you have to
0:45
understand why these moments work in the
0:48
first place. So, let's break down the
0:50
psychology behind it. It all started
0:53
with the Nobel Prizeinning psychologist
0:56
Daniel Conan discovering that our brain
0:59
doesn't remember an experience as a
1:02
whole. It compresses it. What we
1:05
actually recall is how we felt at the
1:07
two specific points I mentioned in the
1:10
beginning of the video. the peak, aka
1:12
the most intense part of the experience,
1:16
and the end, aka the last part of the
1:19
experience. Everything else is basically
1:22
just noise. And nowhere is this better
1:25
illustrated than at the Disney theme
1:27
parks because to be honest, like waiting
1:30
in line for 90 minutes in the sun,
1:32
hustling between attractions, and
1:35
fighting for $10 fries, all of that kind
1:38
of sucks. I mean, it's very clear that
1:40
not everything about the Disney
1:43
experience is smooth. But Disney knew
1:45
something most theme parks didn't. They
1:48
could intentionally design what visitors
1:51
remember. And they did so by leaning in
1:53
hard on the high points, the peaks, and
1:56
making sure the final moment before you
1:59
left the park, the end, felt carefully
2:02
crafted. Whether that was a surprise
2:05
interaction with a character, the last
2:07
firework show of the night, or even the
2:10
music playing as you exit the park,
2:12
everything is deliberately timed to a
2:15
peak and then gently winds down to a
2:17
great ending. And as a result, about
2:20
70%, again, 70% of Disney park visitors
2:26
come back for a second visit. Not
2:28
because the entire day was flawless, but
2:32
because the moments they remember were.
2:35
So, if Disney can pull this off in a
2:37
6-hour, $200 experience, what could you
2:41
do with your app in a couple of minutes?
2:44
Well, turns out a lot. But before we
2:46
look at how Airbnb does this in their
2:48
app, if you want to talk about this or
2:51
anything else design related with a team
2:53
that has many decades of design
2:55
experience, then check out the free
2:57
design strategy calls we do at SIPAP.
3:00
It's in the link down below. Now, let's
3:03
zoom in on Airbnb. They're known for
3:05
being one of the most design focused
3:08
companies on the planet. But what truly
3:10
sets them apart is how they sweat the
3:12
small stuff. Every screen feels like it
3:15
was crafted by hand. When you open the
3:18
app, you're met with friendly openings
3:20
and subtle animations. Even their icon
3:24
set comes alive as you switch between
3:26
tabs in the app. And all of this helps
3:29
make the experience truly top tier. But
3:32
the strongest parts of the app comes
3:34
later because Airbnb knows that the
3:37
first core moment for guests, the one
3:39
they really want to elevate into a peak,
3:43
is when they find that perfect listing.
3:45
Knowing this, they sprinkle in nice
3:48
little micro animations and supporting
3:50
tags showing the unique value to your
3:53
specific pick, all to make you feel
3:55
confident and excited in that peak
3:58
moment. Then once you make the decision
4:01
to reserve your booking, they end your
4:03
experience with a super slick purchase
4:06
animation in their trademark 3D style.
4:09
And while these things may seem a bit
4:11
trivial at a first glance, knowing how
4:13
datadriven the team at Airbnb is, it's
4:16
pretty safe to assume that this exact
4:19
peak experience has been tested
4:22
extensively to help boost their booking
4:24
rates. However, with that said, peak and
4:26
moments can come in more forms than just
4:29
elevating actions like booking a
4:32
listing. The Apple Design Award winner
4:34
ahead uses these moments to create a
4:37
really sticky and friendly user
4:40
experience. Most wellness apps lean on
4:43
moral pressure or habit dashboards. But
4:46
Ahead took a different path. They
4:48
designed a flow that guides you kindly
4:50
from start to finish. Let's take when
4:52
you first download the app. You're
4:54
welcomed with a smooth, quiet splash
4:58
screen that really sets the vibe of the
5:01
app immediately. Then you ease into a
5:04
self-p profofiling journey, answering
5:06
key questions at just the right cadence.
5:09
But while this is all really
5:11
well-crafted and amazing, it's not the
5:14
peak or the end. Because as the
5:17
experience continues, you're not just
5:19
shown a report. You get a carefully,
5:23
deliberately designed peak experience, a
5:26
brief that just gets constructed right
5:29
in front of you, making you as a user
5:31
feel like this is made for me at just
5:34
the right moment. Then as the grand
5:37
finale before closing the app, you'll
5:39
get a gentle nudge to come back
5:42
tomorrow, subtly reinforcing that your
5:45
time meant something and that we care to
5:48
see you coming back to the app. So, this
5:50
is a great example of how to use the
5:53
peak rule to create more stickiness with
5:56
our users in a friendly way. But what if
5:59
we want to use the peak and power to
6:01
have users directly contribute to
6:04
reducing churn on our app? That's where
6:07
Uber comes in with one of their most
6:09
popular UI patterns. Because while Uber
6:12
can't really brag about fancy skumorphic
6:16
icons or super cool animations, there's
6:19
one thing they reliably do better than
6:21
most. They end the journey extremely
6:24
well. After a ride, you don't just exit
6:27
the car and call it a day. You're giving
6:30
a tight little peak and flow, a
6:33
vibration of the phone, and a double
6:35
reward opportunity. Rate your driver and
6:38
leave a tip. And it's not enforced. It's
6:41
gentle and it's polite because Uber
6:44
knows their riders already experienced
6:46
the peak which was about reaching their
6:49
destination. So all they have to do is
6:52
wrap a sense of completion into the
6:54
ending. A completion that might give the
6:57
driver an additional tip and help grow
7:00
their reputation which in turn helps
7:03
keep the drivers on Uber's platform.
7:06
This of course creates a really virtuous
7:08
cycle where satisfied drivers provide
7:11
better experiences which encourages
7:14
riders to use Uber more frequently which
7:17
in turn further increases demand and
7:20
supply reliability for Uber. A win-win
7:23
for the users and a great business
7:25
outcome for the company. But now the
7:28
question is how do you apply this to
7:31
your context? How do you take the same
7:33
patterns with intentional peaks and good
7:36
endings and leverage it to make users
7:39
crazy about your product? Well, I'm
7:42
going to show you step by step how I
7:44
would guide clients through it at SIPAP.
7:47
But first, if you want this actually
7:50
applied to your context, or if you just
7:52
want to chat about a new website, a
7:55
rebrand, or a product design in general,
7:58
again, take a look at our free strategy
8:01
calls in the link down below. Now, the
8:03
step-by-step guide. As a first step, you
8:06
want to map out your entire customer
8:09
journey. You can use sticky notes on a
8:11
wall or a digital board in a tool like
8:13
Fig Jam. doesn't really matter, but I
8:16
prefer to have it online, so I just use
8:19
Fig Jam. Then you lay out every step
8:21
your user takes in your core flow from
8:24
sign up to task completion to whatever
8:28
the end looks like in your product.
8:31
After that, ask questions like, where is
8:33
the user slowed down? Where might stress
8:36
peak? Where's the quiet in between? Save
8:40
the result of this exercise and treat it
8:42
as a living tool you will iterate on as
8:45
your product evolves. The next step is
8:47
to pick your magical moment or your one
8:51
welltimed peak. Pick just one spot in
8:53
the journey to spark it. For example,
8:56
after a user completes a core task,
8:59
right when they hit a milestone or at a
9:02
point when they're investing a lot of
9:04
effort. This is where you place the holy
9:07
dang moment. could be a badge, a
9:09
sparkle, an animation, or just surprise
9:12
copy that lifts the experience above
9:15
what's expected. But remember, don't say
9:18
the magic for the end. Peak first,
9:20
because a lot of apps just end. They
9:23
fall off without closure or the feeling
9:26
of you're done or you're doing great.
9:29
And that, ladies and gents, is what we
9:32
call a missed opportunity. So instead,
9:35
use the ending state for something like
9:38
celebrating what was done, encouraging
9:40
what comes next or reaffirming progress.
9:44
It might be a check mark or a summary
9:46
card or even a message like you showed
9:49
up today. That's huge. The bottom line
9:52
is it doesn't have to be fancy, but it
9:55
should be designed with intent. Then as
9:58
the fourth step, bring out the vacuum
10:01
cleaner. Look at your weight screens,
10:03
your error states, your long forms, and
10:05
ask yourself, where might someone feel
10:07
stuck or uncertain? Then make an effort
10:10
to wrap those moments in true care.
10:13
Again, use microcopy that's uplifting or
10:17
add tools that help before they even
10:19
ask, or use delays as opportunities
10:23
instead of dead space. Because negative
10:26
moments are as memorable as positive
10:29
ones. So, make sure you do your absolute
10:32
best to locate them and reduce them.
10:35
Then lastly, just run variations of your
10:38
peak moments. Try timing changes, emojis
10:42
versus icons, animations versus static
10:46
feedback. Watch where people drop off,
10:49
and where they stay around a bit longer
10:51
than expected or necessary. That's your
10:54
signal to jump in and tweak the
10:57
experience. Now, if you want guidance on
10:59
any of this, we're happy to help at

pretty sure you'll love this video here

that is about very related stuff. It's
11:19
about emotional design and how apps like
11:21
Dualingo and Revolute use it to crush
11:24
their competition. Now, until the next
11:27
one though, have a great
