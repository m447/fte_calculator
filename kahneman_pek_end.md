This concept comes from the Nobel Prize-winning psychologist **Daniel Kahneman**. You are referring to his discovery of the **Peak-End Rule** and the distinction between the "Experiencing Self" and the "Remembering Self."

Your intuition about "compression" is spot on. Kahneman found that the brain does not record experiences like a video camera that saves every second on a tape. Instead, it takes "snapshots" to save energy and storage space.

Here is the breakdown of why your brain ignores the length of an experience and focuses only on the highlight reel.

### 1. The Two Selves

To understand why we compress memories, Kahneman distinguished between two different "selves" inside you:

* **The Experiencing Self:** This is the "you" living in the present moment. It feels every second of pain or pleasure as it happens. It answers the question: *"How do I feel right now?"*
* **The Remembering Self:** This is the "you" that looks back at the past. It keeps the score and tells the story. It answers the question: *"How was it?"*

**The Conflict:** The Remembering Self is the one in charge. When you decide to go back to a restaurant or take a vacation, the Remembering Self makes the decision, not the Experiencing Self.

### 2. The Peak-End Rule (The Compression Algorithm)

Because the Remembering Self cannot store every second of an event, it uses a heuristic (a mental shortcut) called the **Peak-End Rule**.

The brain judges and "compresses" an entire experience based on the average of only two points:

1. **The Peak:** The most intense moment (positive or negative).
2. **The End:** How the experience concluded.

Everything else—especially how long the experience lasted—is largely forgotten. Kahneman calls this **Duration Neglect**. A 20-minute painful medical procedure is remembered as *less* painful than a 10-minute one, provided the 20-minute one ends on a gentle note.

### 3. The Famous Colonoscopy Experiment

Kahneman proved this with a study of patients undergoing colonoscopies (which were painful in the 1990s).

* **Patient A:** Had a procedure that lasted **8 minutes**. The pain spiked (Peak) and ended abruptly while it was still painful (End).
* **Patient B:** Had a procedure that lasted **24 minutes** (much longer). He had the same high pain spikes, but towards the end, the doctor let the instrument rest still for a few minutes, causing only mild discomfort before removing it (a better End).

**The Result:** Even though Patient B suffered for three times as long, **Patient B remembered the experience as less painful** than Patient A. His Remembering Self compressed the experience into "Bad Peak + Mild End = Manageable," whereas Patient A compressed it into "Bad Peak + Bad End = Terrible."

### 4. Real-Life Examples

* **Movies:** You can watch a brilliant 2-hour movie, but if the ending is terrible, your brain "ruins" the memory of the whole film. You ignore the 110 minutes of enjoyment because of the final 10 minutes.
* **Vacations:** A two-week vacation is not remembered as "twice as good" as a one-week vacation. You mostly remember the best moment (the view from the mountain) and the final moment (the rush to the airport or the final dinner).
* **Breakups:** You might have a happy 5-year relationship, but if the breakup (the End) is messy and angry, you will likely remember the whole relationship as "bad," ignoring the years of daily happiness.

### Summary

Your brain compresses experience to make it easier to store. It deletes the timeline (Duration Neglect) and saves a simplified thumbnail consisting of the **Peak** (intensity) and the **End** (closure).
