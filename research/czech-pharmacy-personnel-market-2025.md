# Market Research: Specialized Pharmacy Personnel Availability in Czech Republic

**Date:** January 2026
**Scope:** Workforce availability, recruitment challenges, platforms, and social media coverage

---

## Executive Summary

The Czech Republic faces significant pharmacy workforce challenges: declining pharmacy numbers (from 2,852 in 2017 to ~2,455 in 2025), severe rural access disparities, and intense market consolidation with Dr.Max and BENU controlling ~75% of the market. The pharmacist density (~60 per 100,000) is below EU norms, and employers now offer signing bonuses up to 200,000 CZK to attract talent. Salary gaps with Germany (30-70% lower) and Austria (50% lower) create brain drain pressure.

## 1. Current Market Situation

### Workforce Statistics

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Pharmacists (registered) | ~9,000 | Czech Chamber of Pharmacists |
| Pharmacy technicians | ~7,000 (estimated) | Industry estimates |
| Pharmacist density | 7.18 per 10,000 population | WHO |
| Pharmacies (2024) | 2,697 (incl. detached units) | ÚZIS |
| Pharmacies (2021) | 2,496 | Statista |
| Inhabitants per pharmacy | 4,045 | ÚZIS |
| 24-hour pharmacies | 16 nationwide | Czech Television |

### Market Trend: Declining Pharmacy Numbers

| Year | Pharmacies | Trend |
|------|------------|-------|
| 2017 | 2,852 | Peak |
| 2021 | 2,496 | -12.5% |
| 2024 | ~2,455 | -14% from peak |

**2022-2023 data:** 142 new pharmacies opened, but 157 closed (net loss of 15)

### The Problem

> Pharmacies are disappearing from small towns and border regions while chains expand in shopping centers in large cities.

- **No legal regulation** of pharmacy density or accessibility
- **Seven regions** have no 24-hour pharmacy
- **10% net loss** of pharmacies in border regions over two years

### Regional Differences

| Region | Situation |
|--------|-----------|
| **Prague** | Oversupply, shopping mall concentration |
| **Jihomoravský kraj** | Highest demand for staff |
| **Moravskoslezský kraj** | High demand |
| **Vysočina** | Growing demand (+54% for technicians) |
| **Border regions** | Pharmacy closures, staff shortages |
| **Rural areas** | Severe undersupply |

**Proposed Solution:** South Bohemian regional assembly proposed allowing "shared head pharmacists" to serve multiple pharmacies.
