# Market Research: Specialized Pharmacy Personnel Availability in Poland

**Date:** January 2026
**Scope:** Workforce availability, recruitment challenges, platforms, and social media coverage

---

## Executive Summary

Poland's pharmacy labor market faces significant structural challenges: a declining number of pharmacies (from 13,600 in 2017 to 11,200 in 2024), uneven geographic distribution, and a sharply declining pharmacy technician workforce (-6.3% in 2024). While there are approximately 56,000 pharmacy workers, the pharmacist-to-pharmacy ratio (1.85) is significantly below the EU average (2.40). The market is shaped by the controversial "Apteka dla Aptekarza" ownership regulations and evolving scope of practice including vaccination services.

## 1. Current Market Situation

### Workforce Statistics (2024)

| Metric | Value | Change vs 2023 | Source |
|--------|-------|----------------|--------|
| Pharmacists (magister farmacji) | 26,200 | +1.5% | GUS |
| Pharmacy technicians | 29,800 | -6.3% | GUS |
| Total pharmacy workers | 56,000 | -2.8% | GUS |
| Generally available pharmacies | 11,200 | -2.1% | GUS |
| Pharmaceutical outlets | 1,100 | -2.2% | GUS |
| Pharmacists per 100,000 inhabitants | 78 | - | OECD |
| Pharmacists per pharmacy | 1.85 | - | EU avg: 2.40 |

### The Paradox

Poland has fewer pharmacists per 100,000 population (78) than the OECD average (86), yet many pharmacists choose alternative career paths in pharmaceutical companies, wholesalers, and laboratories rather than community pharmacy work.

**Key Issues:**
- Declining number of pharmacies (peak 13,600 in 2017 → 11,200 in 2024)
- Sharp decline in pharmacy technicians (no new training pipeline)
- Competition from pharmaceutical industry for talent

### Regional Differences

| Region | Situation |
|--------|-----------|
| **Mazowieckie (Warsaw)** | Highest concentration of pharmacists |
| **Śląskie (Silesia)** | Strong pharmaceutical market |
| **Wielkopolskie** | Good coverage |
| **Opolskie, Lubuskie** | Lowest pharmacist concentration |
| **Rural areas** | Only 12.8% of pharmacists work rurally |

**Critical Rural-Urban Disparity:**
- Nearly 40% of Poles live in rural areas
- Only 12.8% of pharmacists work in rural areas
- Over 400 rural municipalities lack any pharmacy
- Rural areas: ~8,200 residents per pharmacy
- Urban areas: ~3,200 residents per pharmacy

## 2. Recruitment Challenges

### Main Employer Difficulties

1. **Competition from other sectors**
   - Pharmaceutical companies offer higher salaries (~6,500 PLN net)
   - Wholesalers and laboratories attract pharmacists away from retail

2. **Geographic mismatch**
   - Most pharmacists prefer urban areas
   - Rural pharmacies struggle to attract and retain staff

3. **Regulatory requirements**
   - 5.5-year master's degree required (no bachelor's path)
   - 6-month mandatory internship
   - Foreign pharmacists must prove no Polish candidate available
   - Polish language proficiency essential

4. **Workload and conditions**
   - Understaffing increases pressure on existing staff
   - Expanding scope of pharmaceutical care without adequate staffing
   - Limited career advancement in community pharmacy

### Brain Drain (Historical and Current)

**Historical (post-EU accession 2004):**
- Significant emigration to UK (31%), Germany (20%), USA (11%)
- 7-9% of practicing doctors and nurses applied for certificates abroad

**Current Trend - Reverse Brain Drain:**
- Poland's brain drain index improved from 6.5 (2007) to 4.6 (2022)
- Poles in Ireland: -24% (122,000 → 93,000)
- Poles in UK: -24% (911,000 → 691,000)
- Real salaries tripled since EU accession
- Poland expected to match UK GDP per capita by end of decade

### Aging Workforce

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Pharmacy technician decline | -6.3% in one year (2023-2024) |
| No new technician training | Old high-school academy system discontinued |
| Gender composition | 83% female pharmacists, 95% female technicians |
| Burnout rates | 62% of pharmacy professionals globally |

### "Apteka dla Aptekarza" Law Impact

**Original 2017 Law (AdA 1.0):**
- Only pharmacists can own new pharmacies
- Geographic criteria: 3,000 residents per pharmacy, 500m minimum distance
- Maximum 1% of pharmacies in a province per entity
- Maximum 4 pharmacies nationally per owner

**2023 Amendment (AdA 2.0):**
- Extended restrictions to pharmacy takeovers
- Aimed to stop chains acquiring existing pharmacies
