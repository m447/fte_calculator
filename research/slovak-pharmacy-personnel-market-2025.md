# Market Research: Specialized Pharmacy Personnel Availability in Slovakia

**Date:** January 2026
**Scope:** Workforce availability, recruitment challenges, platforms, and social media coverage

---

## Executive Summary

Slovakia faces a paradoxical pharmacy workforce situation: while there are sufficient pharmacists overall (~5,000), the excessive number of pharmacies (~1,800-2,200) creates distribution challenges and staffing strain. The market is characterized by significant brain drain to higher-paying countries, regional disparities in coverage, and recruitment difficulties affecting 82% of healthcare employers.

## 1. Current Market Situation

### Workforce Statistics

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Registered pharmacists | 5,000+ | Slovak Chamber of Pharmacists |
| Hospital pharmacists | 120 | EAHP |
| Hospital pharmacies | 32 | EAHP |
| Community pharmacies | 1,800-2,200 | 4liberty.eu |
| Pharmacists per 100,000 inhabitants | 49 | Eurostat (2017) |

### The Paradox

> "Practically across the entire territory of Slovakia there are unnecessarily many pharmacies, and secondarily therefore also a shortage of pharmacy professionals"
> — Peter Stanko, President of Slovak Chamber of Pharmacists

- The problem is **not the absolute number of pharmacists**, but the high number of pharmacies requiring staff
- Number of pharmacies increased by ~50% over the last 15 years
- Many pharmacy graduates leave for other sectors (wholesale, manufacturing, marketing)

### Regional Differences

| Region | Situation |
|--------|-----------|
| **Bratislava** | Adequate coverage, better salaries, more opportunities |
| **Eastern Slovakia** | Higher unemployment (10.7%), limited healthcare access |
| **Rural areas** | 79% of municipalities lack pharmacies |
| **Urban centers** | Pharmacy concentration, sometimes oversupply |

**Note:** No pharmacy in Slovakia operates after 10:00 PM as of 2025.

## 2. Recruitment Challenges

### Brain Drain

Slovakia experiences significant emigration of pharmacy professionals to higher-paying countries:

| Destination | Wage Multiple vs Slovakia |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Austria | 2.3x (avg annual: $67,431 vs $29,838) |
| Germany | 2.1x (avg annual: $62,473) |
| Czech Republic | 1.5x (primary destination) |
| UK, Ireland, Netherlands | 1.5-2x |

**Key drivers:**
- Foreign salaries 1.5-3x higher than Slovak wages
- Better working conditions abroad
- Pharmacists among top 10 most mobile professions in Europe

### Employer Hiring Difficulties

- **82% of healthcare/pharmaceutical employers** report difficulty filling vacancies
- Slovak Chamber of Pharmacists warns that current pharmacy revenues from prescription drug dispensing are insufficient even for pharmacist salaries
- Underutilization of pharmacist competencies compared to UK model

### Aging Workforce

| Metric | 2017 | 2040 (projected) |
|--------|------|------------------|
| Workers aged 55-64 | 13.4% | 26.1% |

- Working-age population expected to shrink by ~20% in 30 years
- Healthcare workforce faces concerns about retirements
